📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report
Employee Performance and Salary Analysis
CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship – Task 2


📌 Project Overview

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focuses on analyzing employee performance and salary data to uncover meaningful insights. The objective is to understand how experience, department, and salary relate to employee performance and to identify patterns that can support organizational decision-making.

This project was developed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship – Task 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis).

🎯 Objectives

Understand the structure and characteristics of employee data

Identify trends and relationships among experience, salary, and performance

Compare department-wise performance and salary distribution

Detect potential data issues such as missing values or anomalies

Support data-driven decision making using exploratory analysis

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python – Programming language

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook / Command Prompt – Development environment

❓ Key Questions for Analysis

Does employee experience influence salary?

Is there a relationship between salary and performance score?

Which department shows the highest performance levels?

Are there any anomalies or missing values in the dataset?

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset contains no missing or null values, indicating good data quality.

Employee experience ranges from 1 to 8 years.

Salaries increase steadily with experience, suggesting a positive correlation.

Performance scores tend to improve as experience increases.

Finance department shows higher average salary and performance compared to others.

📊 Key Insights

Higher experience is associated with higher salary and better performance

Finance department has the highest performing employees on average

Marketing employees show consistent growth in performance with experience

No data inconsistencies or outliers were detected
